Hey everyone, this is AstroTrader! It's a game where you become a galactic trader – exploring star systems, buying and selling commodities, and upgrading your ship with unique NFT blueprints to build your trading empire.

<!-- Visual: Quick montage (2-3 seconds each): Starmap navigation, Market interaction, Shipyard with a blueprint. -->

**Host:**
We've all seen how getting into Web3 games can sometimes be a bit of a hassle with wallets and setup. For AstroTrader, I wanted to make that super smooth.

<!-- Visual: Show the AstroTrader login screen. Cursor clicks "Sign In". Google login flow (brief). Redirect back. -->

**Host:**
That's where Civic Auth comes in. You can just sign in with Google, like you normally would.

<!-- Visual: If new user, "Initialize Guild Wallet" button appears. Click it. Brief "Initializing..." -->

**Host:**
And for new players, Civic instantly sets up a secure Solana wallet right in the game – no extra extensions or seed phrases needed. It's all handled.

<!-- Visual: "Claim Starting Package" modal. Click "Claim". Success toast. HUD updates with Galactic Credits. -->

**Host:**
To get started, every new trader gets some initial Galactic Credits – that's our in-game currency, which is actually an SPL token on Solana – and a bit of SOL for those first network fees.

<!-- Visual: Point to Galactic Credits in HUD. Navigate Starmap to a planet like Mars Colony. Market panel updates. -->

**Host:**
Alright, let's make some trades. My Galactic Credits are real tokens in my embedded wallet. I'll head to Mars Colony... looks like Tech Components are for sale.

<!-- Visual: In Market, input quantity for "Tech Components". Click "Buy". CRITICAL: Clearly show the Civic transaction confirmation pop-up. User approves. -->

**Host:**
I'll buy one. Because this is an on-chain transaction using my Galactic Credits, Civic's embedded wallet just asks me to confirm. Simple as that.

<!-- Visual: Success toast. HUD updates: GC decrease, Cargo increases. -->

**Host:**
And done! Credits transferred, cargo updated. That's a real blockchain trade, made easy.

<!-- Visual: Navigate to "Shipyard" tab. Click "Debug: Get Placeholder Cargo Blueprint". -->

**Host:**
Ship upgrades in AstroTrader are NFT blueprints. Let's get one now.

<!-- Visual: Success toast. Blueprint NFT appears in "Owned Blueprints". Point to it. -->

**Host:**
This "Expanded Cargo Bay" blueprint was just minted as an NFT directly to my embedded wallet. I actually own this on the blockchain.

<!-- Visual: Point to "Current Ship Stats" showing increased Cargo Capacity. Also highlight it in the main header HUD. -->

**Host:**
And because I own it, its effect is active – my ship's cargo capacity is now bigger! My progress, including my ship's state and these NFT effects, is saved so I can pick up where I left off.

<!-- Visual: A final engaging shot of the game – perhaps flying through the starmap or a cool view of the interface. -->

**Host:**
So, that's a quick look at AstroTrader. By using Civic Auth, the goal was to make interacting with on-chain assets like SPL tokens and NFTs feel like a natural part of the game, not a barrier. It really streamlines getting players into a Web3-enhanced experience.
